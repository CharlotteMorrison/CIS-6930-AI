# End-to-End ML Project steps
* Look at the big picture
* Get the data
* Discover and visualize the data to gin insights<br/>
-there are python packages to use for visualizations
* Prepare the data for ML algorithms<br/>
-the data may not be ready to use (incomplete, missing values, null values)<br/>
-determine if continuous or categorical data categories<br/>
-ML algorithms typically want numerical values only, we may need to convert

#### The next steps are relatively straightforward if using off-the-shelf solutions
* Select a model and train it<br/>
-what kind of problem: regression (because continuous values)
* Fine-tune the model<br/>
-deal with overfitting (surprisingly good), won't generalize to the future<br/>
-ensemble learning
-underfitting<br/>
-try and get the best model with the training set
* Present your solution to the test set
* Launch, monitor, and maintain your system
