# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
## Naive-Bayes Classification
* NB uses a  CountVectorizer with the bag of words method for splitting the tweets into tokens and counting the frequency. 
The stopwords are removed, accents are removed, and the words are converted to lower case. TfidfTransformer is used to
apply the frequency weighting.
* CountVectoriser uses the bag of words method for splitting the tweets into tokens and counting the frequency. Also, the
stopwords are removed, accents are removed and the words are converted to lower case.<br/>
* TfidfTransformer is used to apply the frequency weighting.<br/>
* A grid search was conducted to find the best set of parameters for the model.<br/>

## Support Vector Classification
The SVM analysis uses sklearn LinearSVC.
The initial tweets are cleaned using regular expressions and stemmed to remove suffixes.<br/><br/>
**Parameters: TfidfVectorizer** 
* min_df=5 (ignore terms with document count lower than 5)
* max_df=0.95 (removes stop-words, high frequency words)
* sublinear_tf=True (apply sublinear scaling)
* ngram_range=(1,2) (upper and lower bounds of n-grams to extract)<br/><br/>
**Parameters: LinearSVC** <br/>
* C=0.1 (penalty parameter of the error term)
* verbose=1 (enable verbose output)

## Dataset: Russian Troll Tweets
This dataset has approximately 3 million tweets send from the Internet Research Agency, the Russian
troll factory identified by the Justice Department as part of special counsel Robert Muller's investigation
into Russian interference in the 2016 election.  The dataset was generated by Clemson University researchers. The full 
dataset is available at:

## Stochastic Gradient Descent
The SVC analysis uses sklearn LinearSVC. The tweets are cleaned using regular expressions and stemmed to remove suffixes. Words with count lower than 5 and stopwords were ignored.
