# Using continuous data
# Distance measures: Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance

# Data must be normalized (convert range between 0.0 and 1.0) if the scale (range) of the data is not consistent.
# If normalization is not done, features with larger ranges will have outsized influence on the model and features
# with smaller ranges won't have appropriate impact.
